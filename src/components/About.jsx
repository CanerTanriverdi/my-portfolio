      <p>
        Hi, I'm Caner, a frontend, backend, and full-stack web developer. My journey into the world of web development
        started with HTML and CSS, and has continued to grow with modern technologies like JavaScript, React, and
        Node.js. I'm currently working on various personal projects and constantly exploring new technologies.{" "}
        <p>
          I'm especially focused on building user-friendly interfaces and strong, scalable backend systems. My goal is
          to be more than just someone who writes code. I aim to solve real problems and care deeply about user
          experience.{" "}
        </p>
        I love learning new things and turning what I learn into real, working applications. I enjoy working in teams
        and believe that exchanging ideas leads to better results. I pay close attention to details and strive to write
        code that is clean, readable, and maintainable. In short, I'm a passionate developer who is always learning and
        growing. I believe that with code, we can build not just projects but dreams.
